Sidekiq::Throttler is a middleware for Sidekiq that adds the ability to rate
limit job execution on a per-worker basis.

## Compatibility

Sidekiq::Throttler is tested against MRI 1.9.3.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sidekiq-throttler'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-throttler

## Configuration

In a Rails initializer or wherever you've configured Sidekiq, add
Sidekiq::Throttler to your server middleware:

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Throttler
  end
end
```

## Usage

In a worker, specify a threshold (maximum jobs) and period for throttling:

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  sidekiq_options throttle: { threshold: 50, period: 1.hour }

  def perform(user_id)
    # Do some heavy API interactions.
  end
end
```

In the above example, when the number of executed jobs for the worker exceeds
50 in an hour, remaining jobs will be delayed.

If throttling is per-user, for example, you can specify a `Proc` for `key` which
accepts the arguments passed to your worker's `perform` method:

```ruby
sidekiq_options throttle: { threshold: 20, period: 1.day, key: ->{ |user_id| user_id } }
```

In the above example, jobs are throttled for each user when they exceed 20 in a
day.

Thresholds can be configured based on the arguments passed to your worker's `perform` method,
similar to how the `key` option works:

```ruby
sidekiq_options throttle: { threshold: -> {|user_id, rate_limit| rate_limit }, period: 1.hour, key: ->{ |user_id, rate_limit| user_id } }
```

In the above example, jobs are throttled for each user when they exceed the rate limit provided in the message. This is useful in cases where each user may have a different rate limit (ex: interacting with external APIs)
